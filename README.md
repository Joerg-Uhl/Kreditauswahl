# Kreditauswahl

A program that offers you the possibility to compare up to 3 different bank credits, the modalities of which can be adjusted by the user. It has a GUI that displays the development over time of cumulative costs, remaining balance and cumulative interest both as line graphs and as tables. The program works, but is not finished by far. It is somewhat slow, has no menu, no option for printing, not even an option for choosing the start date:).
